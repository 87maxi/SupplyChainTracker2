# Final Fix for EnhancedPendingRoleRequests.tsx

The file had syntax errors due to improper JSX closing and extra braces. Here's the corrected structure:

```typescript
  return (
    <>
    <Card>
      <!-- Card content -->
    </Card>
    </>
  );
}
```

The component should have proper closing tags and exactly one closing brace for the function.
